# Online Store

This project is based on the online store in which customers can register themselves and create an account on this system.

It has two modules, administrator and customer.

A customer can create an account for themselves only while an administrator can create an account for them as well can 
create another admin account.

In this project, I have implemented only few things which is done with the pure Servlets & JSP concepts without using any
framework such as Spring.

An admin or customer can upload their files.

### Why it is useful?

This is useful in setting up a platform where user can log in based on their role and the homescreen will display based on
the account type it has.

It has totally different views for the Admin and Customer.

### How to get started?

Just import the project in your eclipse and setup the database connection and then run on the tomcat.

### Technologies Involded.

1. Java
2. Servlets
3. JSP
4. JDBC
5. MySQL
